# Sales-Dashboard

Dashboard for the “Super Store Sales” dataset using Power BI visualisations tools.

In this dashboard I’ve incorporated data analysis techniques, specializing in time series analysis to deliver valuable insights.

This dashboard displays some major KPIs like :
1. Sales of the store
2. Total Order
3. Total Profit
4. Average no. of days for shipment

Part from that it displays stats like “Sales by Category of product” & “Monthly sales by YoY”.
Tried using the Map View to demonstrate “Sales & Profit by States” and also got my hands on the “forecasting tool” in Power BI for the first time to forecast the data for 15 days.
